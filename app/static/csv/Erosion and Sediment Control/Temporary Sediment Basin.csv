Temporary sediment basin should be used for drainage areas that are greater than or equal to 3 acres and less than100 acres.,Confirm the total drainage area going into the sediment basin. The areas must be between 3 acres and 100 acres. ,(VESCH 3.14)
"The design capacity of the basin should be at least 134 cubic yards per acre of total contributing drainage area. One half of the design volume shall be in the form of a permanent pool, and the remaining half as drawdown volume. Sediment basin dimensions shall be shown on the plan.",Clarify if the sediment basin is sized correctly for the contributing drianage area. The sediment basin must be sized at least 134 cubic yards per acre of the contributing drainage area.,(VESCH 3.14)
"The length of the basin should be twice the width, otherwise baffles should be used.",The length to width ratio is not 2:1 or greater. Revise the length of the basin or provide a baffle design. ,(VESCH Plate 3.14-6 Appendix 3.14a)
Anti-vortex device and trash rack shall be attached to the top of the principal spillway to improve the flow characteristics.,Provide a trash rack to the sediment basin riser.,VESCH Plate 3.14-10
The crest of the principal spillway shall be set at the elevation corresponding to a total storage of 134 cubic yards per acre.,Revise the design so that the crest of the principal spillway is set at the elevation corresponding to 134 cubic yards per acre or a more conservative approach. ,(VESCH 3.14)
A minimum of 1 ft freeboard should be provided between the 25-years WSE storm event and the top of embankment if an emergency spillway is used in conjunction with the principal spillway.,Provide the minimum 1' freeboard between the 25-year storm and the top of embankment. ,(VESCH Plate 3.14-2)
The crest of principal spillway shall be a minimum of 3 ft below the top of the embankment if no emergency spillway is provided. The minimum freeboard shall be two feet between the 25-year storm WSE and the top of embankment.,Provide the minimum 3' freeboard between the 25-year storm and the top of embankment. 3' is required because there is no  ,(VESCH Plate 3.14-2)
Provision should be made to dewater the sediment basin down to the permanent pool elevation. It is necessary to provide at least 6-hour drawdown time in the dry storage area to achieve up to 60% removal of sediments.,Ensure that the sediment basin draws down within 6 hours time to achieve ideal sediment removal rate. ,(VESCH 3.14 VESCH Apdx. 3.14-a)
"The base of the principal spillway must be firmly anchored to prevent flotation. If the riser height is greater than 10 ft., provide computations and verify a minimum factor of safety of 1.25 is made against flotation.",Provide bouyancy calculations for the principal spillway or show how it will be firmly anchored.,(VESCH 3.14)
"The barrel for the combined spillway shall be designed to safely pass the 25-years storm event, and the outlet of the barrel must be protected to prevent erosion or scour of downstream area.","Ensure that the principal spillway has been designed to pass the 25-year storm, the downstream pipe has capacity, and the outfall has adeqaute outfall protection.",(VESCH App. 3.14-a)
Anti-seep collars shall be used on the barrel of the principal spillway if the settled height of the embankment exceeds 10 ft or when the embankment has a low silt content. The anti-seep collars shall be installed within the saturated zone. Collars shall not be closer than 2 ft to a pipe joint and the maximum spacing between collars shall be 14 times the projection of the collars above the barrel.,Clarify if anti-seep collars are required for the embankment design. ,(VESCH App. 3.14-a)
When a separate emergency spillway is used the capacity of both principal and emergency spillway should be able to carry the 25-years storm.,Revise the emergency spillway design to accommodate the 25-year storm. ,(VESCH 3.14)
Emergency spillway should not be constructed in fill areas. Avoid sharp turns or bends when locating the spillway channel.,Revise the emergency geometry. There are sharp turns and bends that are not compliant with the specification. ,(VESCH 3.14)
Check for maximum allowable velocity of spillway channel using Table 3.17-A,Verify the permissible velocity of the spillway channel. See VESCH Table 3.17-A for reference. ,(VESCH 3.14)
Embankment should receive temporary or permanent seeding immediately after installation.,Provide a note that says the earthen emankment will stabilized immediately after construction.,(VESCH 3.14)
