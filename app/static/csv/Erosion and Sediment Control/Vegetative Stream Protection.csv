Vegetative streambank stabilization shall only be applied when bankfull flow velocity does not exceed 5 fps and soils are erosion resistance. Above 5 fps structural measures are required.,Clarify if the velocities in the ditch are erosive or non-erosive and if the permissible velocity of the lining has been exceeded.,(VESCH 3.22)
Ensure that the channel bottom are stable before stabilizing channel banks. Keep velocities at a non-erosive rate. Meet the design criteria established in Table 3.22-A for vegetative stabilization.,Provide a note that all ditches and swales must be stabilized by approved planting immediately after construction.,(VESCH 3.22)
Ensure that the plants used are deemed or considered to be acceptable per VESCH 3.22,Ensure that the plants used are deemed or considered to be acceptable per VESCH 3.22,(VESCH 3.22)
Follow the seed mixture noted in Table 3.22-B of VESCH for appropriate plantings,The seed mixture for stabilization must be acceptable per VESCH 3.22. Update accordingly.,(VESCH 3.22)
