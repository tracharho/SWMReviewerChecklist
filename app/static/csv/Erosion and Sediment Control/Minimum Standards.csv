"Adequacy of outfall channels and pipes shall be verified in following manners: (a) Analysis shall be made to a point having drainage area equal to 100 times contributing site area (b) natural channel shall be analyzed using two year storm for overtopping and erosive velocity (c ) Provide a detailed site-specific outfall narrative. (d) Provide outfall location(s) map and all detailed outfall analysis computations (e) At least 3 to 5 cross-sections, selected at critical locations shall be utilized to verify the adequacy of outfall. Cross-sectional data must be based on field survey data or 2 ft contour intervals. (f) Cross-sections must have same vertical and horizontal scale to give clear picture of bed & banks (g) Outfall velocities shall be compared with erosive velocities of existing channel. (h) The use of 1 -yr extended detention is recommended to remedy existing downstream channel erosion problems","MS-19 states that stormwater design criteria IIB water quantity compliance must be shown as part of development. Provide the necessary documents showing water quantity (Channel Protection and Flood Protection) compliance.
